# Boxcar

Boxcar is the Rails application template used at
[Smashing Boxes](https://smashingboxes.com/) according to our best practices.

## Requirements
This template currently assumes:
  - Rails 4.2.5
  - PostgreSQL

and that the application will be deployed using:
  - Unicorn
  - Tape

## Installation
To create a new Rails app with this template, do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/smashingboxes/boxcar.git
rails new [app_name] -m boxcar/template.rb -B
```
Note that the ``-B`` is optional and equivalent to ``--skip-bundle``. Since there is a bundle install command inside the template, the final bundle when creating a new Rails app is unnecessary.

## Options
When using this template, you will be asked one or more questions to determine what type of Rails app to generate. There are 3 types of apps you can select:

1. API Only
  - Answer 'y' to the question "Is this an API app? (y/n)".
  - Answer 'n' to the question "Does this API app have an admin interface? (y/n)"
2. API with Admin Interface
  - Answer 'y' to the question "Is this an API app? (y/n)".
  - Answer 'y' to the question "Does this API app have an admin interface? (y/n)"
3. Interactive
  - Answer 'n' to the question "Is this an API app? (y/n)".

## What does it do?
The template will generate a Rails app using ``rails new``, and then will customize the app according to the template. Depending on the type of template you are generating, the template will modify the following:

1. API Only
  - Modify the Gemfile
  - Remove files from the app directory, including helpers, views, and assets > javascripts and stylesheets
  - Modify the application_controller.rb file for an API
  - Option to install the gem 'devise_token_auth'
  - Option to install the gem 'smashing_docs'

2. API with Admin Interface
  - Modify the Gemfile  
  - Remove Turbolinks
  - Option to install the gem 'devise_token_auth'
  - Option to install the gems 'cucumber-rails' and 'capybara'
  - Option to install the gem 'smashing_docs'

3. Interactive
  - Modify the Gemfile
  - Remove Turbolinks
  - Option to install the gem 'devise'
  - Option to install the gems 'cucumber-rails' and 'capybara'

Once these app-type dependent modifications are complete, the template will modify the following:

  - Create database.yml configured for postgresql
  - Create database.example.yml and secrets.example.yml
  - Create .rubocop.yml file for local linting
  - Create .travis.yml file correctly configured
  - Append .gitignore with secret_token.rb, secrets.yml and database.yml
  - Bundle install and installation of gem configs:
    * rspec
    * factory_girl_rails
    * database_cleaner
    * shoulda_matchers
    * codeclimate-test-reporter
    * taperole
  - Installation of optional gem configs:
    * smashing_docs
    * devise
    * devise_token_auth
    * cucumber-rails
    * capybara
  - Cleanup of auto-generated files that fail local linting
  - Remove test directory
  - Generate README.md
  - Create development and test databases
  - Initialize git
